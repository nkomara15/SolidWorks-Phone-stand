# SolidWorks Phone Stand

A functional phone stand modeled using SolidWorks as a first CAD project to develop foundational 3D modeling skills.

## Skills Practiced
- Feature-based modeling (Extrude, Extruded Cut, Fillet)
- Using Smart Dimension to control geometry
- Working with precise measurements
- Designing with basic 3D printing considerations in mind

## Notes
This project was completed as part of guided learning to become familiar with SolidWorks tools and workflows.  
The design was modified to explore how changes to features affect the final model.
